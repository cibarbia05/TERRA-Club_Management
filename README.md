# Club Management System
**Purpose: Help TERRA have an organized system where administrators, club sponsors, club officers, and club members can all collaborate to reach their specific goal.**

## Important Note:
•	Everything here is subject to changes to accommodate the needs of clubs.
#How it will work:
There will be hierarchy of power and abilities in the web application:
1)	The **administrator(s)** will have the ability to access any content of any lower part of the hierarchy such as club roster documents, mission statements, all sponsors, club officers, and club members. This person(s) will also have the ability to search for people and what they are enrolled as, or to search by club and find all the contents of it including its participants and information on it (such as what their purpose is). However, private user information such as passwords are kept away from the administrators and everyone else.
2)	The **club sponsors and officers** (including presidents, vice-president, etc) will have a lower ranking as they cannot access files from different clubs or look at any other club’s content. These people will be assigned “clubs” to manage. In this, they can tun in documents required my administrators and they can keep track of who is in the club. They can search for specific club members or view an entire list. Clubs and the people of this level will be able to administer calendars for administrators and more importantly club members to see (they will be kept private to its own club members and not those form other clubs). In this calendar the club managers (sponsors and officers) can input any requirements or meetings for its members to see. They can add automatic meeting creation either very month or every week on the calendar, or they can manually set up their meeting dates (in any case of emergency they will be able to cancel or postpone a meeting). Club Managers will be able to showcase their club for other students to see before becoming members, these include informational ppts, images, or “bragging content”. Club managers have the ability to remove club members.
3)	The **club members** will have the ability to join clubs during club rush. To join clubs each clupage on the web application will have a club list for users who have accounts to join the specific clubs. These users will be prompted with a specific message before join saying, “Are you sure you want to join, if you want to leave the club at a later time you will have to talk to any club manager for them to remove you”. 
## Automatic Form Creation:
Every club will have its meeting in the calendar for that specific club (which members can see). Clubs will also be required to state the meeting hours (for example 11:30 to 12:30), so that an automatic form for attendance is created at that time for users to sign and close a few minutes after the meeting is over. (maybe put code in the class for people to see and type to check they are actually in the club, when they are going to fill the form). Once the form is submitted the data will be uploaded to the database.
If the administrator(s) or club managers want to check who attended they will be sent to an excel sheet were everything is there, and they can download it

## Creating Accounts:
To create accounts everyone will have to type in their school email and will receive a verification email with a link with to a page on the website with their info -including their name and their id. In this page they will be able to type and retype their password and create their account.

For Club Administrators to create accounts they will have to be verified by Mr. Sirven
For Club Sponsors to create accounts they will either need permission from administrators or they will need to have a verified teacher id.
For Club Officers to create accounts they will have to be verified via email by Club Sponsors.

## Additional Information:
Inspiration for idea:
As the president of chess club and officer of coding club I have been able to see some weaknesses and opportunities for improvement in the physical management system of the clubs. For example, every club must physically turn in mission statements, attendance rosters, and additional required information; not only is this time-consuming, but also very disorganized because these physical papers could easily get lost, and an online place like this web app can help keep everything in one single place, for quick and easy access by administrators. Another problem that I have seen is the fact that clubs keep track of their members in many distinct ways leading to the use of time taking process and disorientation of who and who isn’t in the club. As a result, the use of this web app proposes that during Club Rush students are still able to sign up for remind, discord, or schoology for easy contact between them and their club leaders, but they should also join their specific clubs through the web app so that club leaders and, more importantly, sponsors can keep track of a yearly list of members and officers with little effort.
## Action Plan:
- Step 1 (Possible Duration: 1 week): Create an outline of the model of the Users in the program (Sponsors, Officers, and Members), which will contain the characteristics and abilities that each will have in the program.
- Step 2 (Possible Duration: 1 week): Create a basic overview of the linking system of the webpage (including what happens when one clicks on links and buttons)
- Step 3 (Possible Duration: 1 week): Set up the settings of the app (including databases, deployment server, static information storage, time zones, and document and image storage)
- Step 4 (Possible Durations: up to 1 week): Search for online programming libraries that might be useful for specific aspects of the app.
- Step 5 (Possible Duration: 1week): Plan the design of the Web app (including colors, where images will be placed, animations, etc)
- Step 6 (Possible Duration: up to 5 months): Implement Views (what the user sees) along with the algorithms that go behind each feature (such as the login system, the calendar, the forms, etc)
- Step 7 (Possible Duration: from 2 to 3 weeks): Gather testing and feedback from the audience to identify bugs in the web app and possible improvements.

The project will require anywhere from 6 to 8 months for it to be fully ready for school usage.
